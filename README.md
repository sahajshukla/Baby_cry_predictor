# Baby_cry_predictor
This is an AI based algorithm that takes the sound wave of a crying baby as an input and predicts the reason for crying. The crying is broadly classified into 5 categories. Namely, Belly_pain, discomfort, hungry, tired, and burping. The dataset is taken from donateacry. The dataset is available on GitHub too.
